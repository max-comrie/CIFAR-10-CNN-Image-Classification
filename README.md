# CIFAR-10-CNN-Image-Classification

This project implements and analyzes a compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.  
It includes a comparison against a fully-connected neural network baseline, data augmentation experiments, 
confidence calibration analysis, and full training/validation curves.

The project demonstrates skills in:
- CNN architecture design (Conv → ReLU → Pooling)
- Data loading, augmentation, and preprocessing
- Model training loops, logging, and evaluation
- Analyzing confidence/uncertainty using softmax distributions
- Comparing CNNs vs MLPs on the same task
